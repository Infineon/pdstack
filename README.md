# PDStack middleware library 3.20

### Overview

The PDStack middleware implements state machines defined in the **Universal Serial Bus Type-C Cable and Connector Specification** and the **Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification**. The middleware provides a set of Device Policy Manager (DPM) APIs through which the application can initialize, monitor, and configure the middleware operation.

The PDStack middleware is released in the form of pre-compiled libraries. The following library variants with a different feature set to help limit the memory footprint of the stack in applications are released.

1) pmg1_pd3_snk_lite – Supports USB Type-C sink operation and USB PD Revision 3.1 messaging.
2) pmg1_pd2_snk_lite – Supports USB Type-C sink operation and USB PD Revision 2.0 messaging. Using this library reduces the flash (code) memory usage by the application.
3) pmg1_pd3_drp      – Supports USB Type-C dual-role operation and USB PD Revision 3.1 messaging. This library can be used in any Power Delivery (PD)application.
4) pmg1_pd3_snk_epr  – Supports USB Type-C sink Extended Power Range (EPR) operation and USB PD Revision 3.1 messaging.
5) pmg1_pd3_drp_epr  - Supports USB Type-C dual-role EPR operation and USB PD Revision 3.1 messaging. This library can be used in any Power Delivery application that requires EPR feature support.
6) pmg1_pd3_drp_epr_cfg - Supports USB Type-C dual role EPR operation, USB PD Revision 3.1 messaging and configurability of stack parameters through the **EZ-PD&trade; Configuration Utility**.
7) wlc1_pd3_snk      - Supports USB Type-C sink operation and USB PD Revision 3.1 messaging. This library can be used in any Power Delivery WLC1 application.

### Features

1) Supports Type-C port configuration and connection detection in the sink, source, and dual-role.
2) Supports EPR in source and sink roles.
3) Supports USB PD communication with the following features:
    * USB PD revision 3.1 compliance
    * USB PD revision 2.0 compliance (backward compatibility)
    * Power contract negotiation in sink and source roles
    * Ability to respond to SOP and SOP messages to support designs with a captive USB-C cable
4) Supports configuration of the port roles and responses through the EZ-PD&trade; Configurator.
5) Supports DPM APIs to initialize, configure, monitor, and control the port operation and to send/receive USB PD messages associated with alternate mode discovery, authentication, firmware update, etc.
